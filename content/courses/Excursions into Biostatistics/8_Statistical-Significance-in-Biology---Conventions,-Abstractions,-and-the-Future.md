I have prepared some {{< staticref "courses/Excursions into Biostatistics/Statistical-Significance-in-Biology---Conventions,-Abstractions,-and-the-Future.pdf" "newtab" >}} Lecture Slides {{< /staticref >}} for this session. Unfortunately, they are in pdf format, so you will have to download them straight to your PC.
