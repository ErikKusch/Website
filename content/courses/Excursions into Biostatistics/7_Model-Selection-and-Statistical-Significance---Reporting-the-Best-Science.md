I have prepared some {{< staticref "courses/Excursions into Biostatistics/Model-Selection-and-Statistical-Significance---Reporting-the-Best-Science.pdf" "newtab" >}} Lecture Slides {{< /staticref >}} for this session. Unfortunately, they are in pdf format, so you will have to download them straight to your PC.
