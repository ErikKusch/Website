## Learning Goals
This is an exercise which is part of the greater [Biological Scientific Research in Theory and Practice](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/50331/Biological-Scientific-Research-in-Theory-and-Practice) scheme at Aarhus University. Here, you will learn how to:  

- Identify vegetation clusters from space  
- Analyse how those clusters have shifted over time  
- Identify areas that have experienced frequent change of predominant biomes  

A few challenges to overcome include:  

- Which vegetation index to use? Which measures therein?  
- How to identify clusters?  
- How to validate the accuracy of our cluster products?  
- How to link resilience to shifts in biome states?  


## Background
**Biomes** are large, somewhat homogeneous biological communities which are usually characterised by one predominant vegetation type. As a consequence of climate change, we expect these to shift poleward leading to a change in landcover classification schemes.

**Resilience** is a concept/charactersitic of a system which enables it to persist in time and place despite perturbations. Global policy makers have adopted resilience goals.
