I have prepared some {{< staticref "courses/An Introduction to Biostatistics/01---An-Introduction-to-Basic-Statistics-for-Biologists_Handout.pdf" "newtab" >}} Lecture Slides {{< /staticref >}} for this session. Unfortunately, they are in pdf format, so you will have to download them straight to your PC.
