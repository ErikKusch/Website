summary: This is a series of lectures and seminars designed for B.Sc. sudents of biology and should serve as an introduction to the basics of biostatistics using R. I teach these topics at the University of Leipzig but invite everyone who stumbles across this repository to make use of what I'm presenting here as all of my material has been designed with the students interest in mind and should thus be self-sufficient.
