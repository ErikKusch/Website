abstract: Throughout my [PhD project](/project/phd-packages/), I aim to understand and predict the consequences of differential extinctions across trophic levels on a global scale. In doing so, I am focusing on drivers of differential extinctions, species-associations, extinction debt, biodiversity changes, shifts in functional communities, as well as ecosystem processes. These are my initial plans which have been set aside in favor of a revised PhD research project with a new set of work packages. My PhD project is a part of the greater [BIORATES](/project/biorates/) project.
