I am a **macroecologist** who has developed a strong affinity to all things **biostatistics**. In my research, I try to understand how biological processes form the patterns in nature through space and time. Most importantly, at least to me, I attempt to understand what makes these processes and resulting patterns withstand perturbations. My ultimate goal is to understand **resilience** using complex statistical methods and **big data**.
